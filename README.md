# Museum tour reservation software
### TypeScript + NodeJS + MongoDB

This project allows museums to add their guided tours to be reserved by 

clients. This makes it easy for both the museum and the possible visitors. The software also 

allows the guide to keep track of their upcoming tours.

Running at https://obscure-retreat-23913.herokuapp.com/find/museums

#### The images are currently stored in Heroku's filesystem so they will not be available for a long time, but you can test images by adding your own when creating a museum

Guides for running the code locally are found in respective folders of backend and frontend.
